<p>It is no secret (or surprise) that the sooner we know how many will attend, the better we can plan for the festival. We want to make it all as awesome for you as possible!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That's why we want to offer the tickets to the fast buyers, cheaper. That makes it easier for us, and easier for you to convince your boss to pay for the ticket.</p>

                As always, Codegarden is a festival for the ones who work with Umbraco. This means that on all three days you’ll find sessions loaded with relevant code and tech demonstrations, news and case studies.

                HOWEVER, this year we want to make Codegarden relevant for a wider audience and we have therefore made sure that a handful of interesting Umbraco related business sessions will take place on day one. Sessions where limited, or no, coding skills are required. Sessions relevant for sales and marketing profiles, CTO's, CEO's of web agencies, designers and everyone else who wants to know how to optimise the way they work in and with Umbraco.
